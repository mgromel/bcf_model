Contents:
- data.xlsx - contains data necessary to reproduce the model
- bcf_model_notebook.ipynb - simple Jupyter notebook script with Python code to reproduce the model, the script loads provided data from the xlsx file, fits models, performs predictions for the training/validation sets and generates basic statistics. These generated results are sufficient to reproduce any plot, graph and remaining statistics presented in the publication. 
- LICENSE - self explanatory
- requirements.txt - lists all libraries and their versions that were used to develop QSAR model
